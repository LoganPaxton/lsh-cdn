# LSH CDN
Welcome to the Lite Shell CDN! If you have a custom package you want me to add, please create a new PR with the package in the correct folder!

## Usage
To use this CDN, first open up your LSH terminal, then run `get https://loganpaxton.github.io/lsh-cdn/custom-commands/helloWorld.c` (Replacing "helloWorld.c" with any of the avaliable packages inside of the "custom-commands" folder. Then, run `sudo restart`, and enter your password to compile the packages. There you go ðŸŽ‰ Now, you should be able to type the filename of the custom command (like "helloWorld") and it will output whatever the command is supposed to do!
